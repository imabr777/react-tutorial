# React Tutorial: Tic Tac Toe

This project is just to showcase my completion of the Tic Tac Toe React tutorial. 

I have added a draw condition to the game status, because the way the tutorial is, when all the squares are filled and there is no winner, it just displays the next player to move, so I added a simple function that checks if all the squares are filled, and added the draw condition (if there is no winner and all the squares are filled) to the game status check.

I also changed the provided CSS a little bit. I thought about making it responsive, but I'd rather move on to other things :P
